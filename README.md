# DigiMenu
A digital menu with comparing features

<br>
<br>
<br>

- Fix CSS for bottles - make px (absolute) based on s8
- Load menu state into App
- Add prop of menu to SelectorView
- In App make a select functionality
- Add Onclick functionality for bottles which passes into TypeSelector then Selector view (which then updates menu)

- fix rotation (still broken)  
    - probably needs two different internal states   
- Tailwind makes it more straightforward for what to do (standard library for everyone)
